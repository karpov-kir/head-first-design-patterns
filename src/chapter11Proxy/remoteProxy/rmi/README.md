# RMI simulation

This folder contains a very naive simulation of RMI. It is not a real RMI implementation, but it is enough to test the Remote Proxy pattern.
The code in this folder is not related directly to the pattern itself, it only provides infrastructure to test the pattern.

There is no inbuilt RMI implementation in Node.JS and even a simple simulation, which lacks a lot of features, is quite cumbersome. It seems the Remote Proxy pattern is not feasible in Node.JS. For example, in Java all RMI code is generated automatically.
